Our group conduct the test by the following steps.Firstly, we use the sample simpletest1,2,3 to ensure the network meet the logic of DV and LS.To further confirm the detailed step of the routing table changes and how the software running.we tried to get the logs generated by the simulator which provide us the detailed information of the DV,and check the logs step by step to ensure the logic meet our expectation.

As DVtable might get large when more routers taken into consideration.We use the sample testcase from the slides that have the count-to-infinity problem,and by printing out the DVtable detail we track the step of poison reverse.Also,following similar ways,we print out all the table related with LS and compare the result with our implementation of LS protocol.

We write simpletest4 to make sure routes are able to correctly send data and  use effective poison reverse to handle count-to-infinity problem in Distance Vector protocol in a more complicated situation,which contains two count-to-infinity situation happens and network delay changed.To further test the robustness of our program,we use Java to generate a network with 40 nodes to emit packet to each other randomly,which is used to test possible buffer overflow or performance problems.
